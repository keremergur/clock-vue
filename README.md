# clock-vue

Entirely custom written vue app using:

```md
- index.htm
- app.js
- style.css
```

With stopwatch and timer functions.  
Can be used simultaneously.

This was made to practice after learning up to Vue components with `.vue` files. I still could have used `app.component()`, but I simply hate writing html inside strings.

Probably unnecessarily efficient.
